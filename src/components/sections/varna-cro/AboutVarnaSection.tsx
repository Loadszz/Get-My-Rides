							Driving in Bulgaria is generally easy, especially along the coast.
							Still, here are some insider tips for driving in Varna:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li className='list-disc ml-[25px]'>
								Parking: Varna has a paid “Blue Zone” downtown, usually active
								on weekdays. You can pay via ticket machines or mobile apps
								(MPark). Outside the center, parking is often free.
							</li>
							<li className='list-disc ml-[25px]'>
								Traffic: Expect heavier traffic near the Cathedral, Sea Garden,
								and central boulevards in summer. If you`re heading to the
								beach, go early in the morning.
							</li>
							<li className='list-disc ml-[25px]'>
								Navigation: Most road signs are in both Cyrillic and Latin
								script. Google Maps and Waze work very well here.
							</li>
							<li className='list-disc ml-[25px]'>
								Fuel: Gas stations are frequent, and many operate 24/7. Both
								diesel and petrol are available - always check what your car
								uses.
							</li>
							<li className='list-disc ml-[25px]'>
								Tolls: Bulgaria uses a digital e-vignette system instead of toll
								booths. Most Varna car hire providers include this in your
								rental, but confirm at pick-up.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							👉 Pro Tip: In summer, try to park at Asparuhovo Beach across the
							bridge - it’s quieter than the city beaches, and locals love it.
